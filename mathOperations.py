# print(2+3) # Addition
# print(3-2) # Subtraction
# print(2*3) # multiplication
# print(6/3) # Division which gives implicit typecasting. This gives out a float.
# print(type(6/3)) # check the type of division in python
# print(6//3) # Division and conversion to an int type
# print(7/3) # Good for general maths operation
# print(7//3) # This gives only the result before . of a floating number
# print(4**2) # Square of a number
# print(2**3) # Cube of a number 
# just like bodmas in python PEMDASLR will work
# Parentheses () - Expressions inside parentheses are evaluated first.
# Exponents ** - Exponential operations are evaluated next.
# Multiplication *, Division /, Floor Division //, and Modulus % - These operations are evaluated from left to right.
# Addition + and Subtraction - - Also evaluated from left to right.#

# result = 3 + 4 * 2 ** 2 / (1 - 5) % 3
# print(result)

#print(round(30.1241,3))

#modulo operator = this gives remainder of how many are remaining after division
